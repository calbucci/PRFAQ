# The PRFAQ Framework
The PRFAQ Framework is the key part of Amazon Working Backwards practice. The book [The PRFAQ Framework: Adapting Amazon's Innovation Framework to Work for You](https://www.thepfaq.com) by Marcelo Calbucci describes it as a system to think critically, articulate ideas, and inspire action.

The PRFAQ provides a method to discover, debate, and decide on a strategy and a vision for a product, business, program, process, service or any other type of innovationâ€”creating something new or changing something that exists.

The people who will benefit from using this framework include:
- Pre-founders who are considering founding a startup
- Founders who are in the early stage of building their startup
- Product and program managers and leaders who want to deliver valuable and viable solutions
- Leaders and executives seeking better cohesion and strategic alignment across people and teams
- Researchers, scientists, inventors, and scholars seeking funding and support for their projects
- Entrepreneurship and innovation professors engaging students in ideation, business concepts, strategy, and pitching
- Leaders in incubators, accelerators, and startup studios, aiming to improve their selection process.
- Pre-seed and seed-stage Venture Capitalists who want to get more clarity from founders seeking funding or their portfolio founder's directions.

The PRFAQ serve for all types of projects and initiatives, including: Business, line of business, product, feature set, program, process, policy, service, invention, and more. It's designed to help innovators who are executive, product/program leaders, inventors, entrepreneurs/founders, managers, etc.

The benefit of using the PRFAQ Framework include:

- Discover gaps in the understanding the value, viability, or feasibility of a project (product, feature, program, etc.)
- Discover gaps in the understanding the customer, their problems, needs, and desires. 
- Discover gaps in the understanding of the market, existing solutions, and the urgency, importance, severity, and direction of the customer's problems.
- Enhance your thinking process to think deeply and critically about the problem, the solution, the go-to-market, the market, and the opportunity.
- Develop a better way to articulate an idea to tell the story and pitch it to investors, backers, funders, and supporters.
- Create the document that will be used to create pitch decks or presentations.
- Involve the team and stakeholders in collaborating to evolve and refine the idea.
- Use it as the key source for vision and strategy
- Reduce team misalignment and miscommunication
- Reduce the number of meetings and email messages throughout the project
